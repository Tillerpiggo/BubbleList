// Making a CloudUploadable version of CKShare so that I can easily "save" the CKShare using the CloudContorller. It needs all the seemingly redundant properties to conform and make the CloudController code easier.
// I may consider reworking the functions in CloudController instead to be able to handle more types than just CloudUploadable, but this will do for now.
